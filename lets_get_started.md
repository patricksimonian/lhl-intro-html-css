#Getting Started

Before we can start coding we need to set up a project folder where all our files and inner folders will live and be organized.

##Step 1

create a folder on your desktop and name it "lighthouse_labs".
**in the programming world it's rare to have words seperated with empty spaces, most of the time you will
find words seperated with hyphens or underscores**

##Step 3
  create two more folders called "styles" and "scripts". **These two folders should be located within the public folder.**
  After this your folder directory should look something like this.
