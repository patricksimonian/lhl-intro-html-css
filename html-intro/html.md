#HTML

So as we discussed in the lecture, HTML stands for Hyper-Text-Markup-Language.
What this really means is that HTML is the language the provides content to a website.
Every word we read, every image we see, every link, or text or password field is created with HTML. 

**one thing to emphasize is that browsers provide some default styling (CSS) to our HTML**
 
 For example, it does things like spaces out paragraph tags. 
 
```
  <p>I'm a paragraph</p>
  <p>I'm another paragraph</p>
```
will look like:
  <p>I'm a paragraph</p>
  <p>I'm another paragraph</p>

It will also change the font size and font weight of header tags.

```
  <h1>Oh hey there</h1>
  <h2>Oh hey there</h2>
  <h3>Oh hey there</h3>
```
will look like:
  <h1>Oh hey there</h1>
  <h2>Oh hey there</h2>
  <h3>Oh hey there</h3>

What's the importance of this? To just realise that when it comes to HTML, all we 
really should care about is what the <strong>content</strong> is and <em>not</em> how it looks!

Okay there's my sermon.. let's get started. 

## Step 1
  First things first, we will need an html file to call home in order to start coding. 
  Do this by creating a file called index.html inside of your project folder. 
  
  ![make new file](/assets/imgs/tutorial-step-8.png)
  
  You project directory in your code editor should look something like this. 
  
  ![directory with index.html](/assets/imgs/tutorial-step-9.png)
