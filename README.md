# Intro To HTML & CSS

Welcome to the Lighhouse Labs Intro to HTML & CSS workshop. 

My name is Patrick Simonian. I graduated from Lighthouse's bootcamp last year in 
December and have been working as a full time dev since!

Today we are going to go take broad overview of how webpages are built with the end goal of leaving this workshop
with a personal profile page hopefully looking something like this...okay let's <strong><a href="">get started!</a></strong>
